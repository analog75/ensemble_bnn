# ensemble_bnn

These codes contain the code and simulation results. 

For running these codes, you should use Ensemble PyTorch framework linked as https://github.com/TorchEnsemble-Community/Ensemble-Pytorch.

We ran the binarized ResNet-18 and ResNet-20 on CIFAR-100 dataset and Bi-Real-Net-18 (https://github.com/liuzechun/Bi-Real-net) using the ensemble library.

This source code for reproducing the experiments will be available upon publication of a manuscript.
